## STEP 1: MOVE ALL TEXT TO LINE 1, THEN NORMALIZE STYLIZED TEXT

# removal all the line breaks
$str = preg_replace('/\n/u', " ", $str);

# normalize digit-percent to words
$str = str_replace("1%", "One-Percent", $str);

$str = str_replace("EQUAL速 0", "EQUAL速 ZERO", $str);

# normalize all the N/A values to dashes

## STEP 2: DELIMIT EACH ENTRY BASED ON COMMON STARTING/ENDING PATTERN

# replace the space between a digit/dash and a capital letter with a pipe
$str = preg_replace_callback(

  },

## STEP 3: SPACE CLEANUP

# replace all remaining new lines with a space
